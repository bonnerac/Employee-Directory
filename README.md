# Employee-Directory

## Desciption
An employee directory with React that is broken up into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## Goals

This app is designed to store, organize, sort, and search through an employee directory

This project uses the Random User Generator: (https://randomuser.me/) to populate the page with users.  



## Complications

During the process of making this directory site, I did run into some problems: 

* Sorting and Searching
    * I had a lot of trouble getting the employees to render on the page through the Random User Generator, but once I got that up and running, I didn't have time to get any sorting/serching done. 


## Credits and Thanks

Thanks to Colin for helping me get my page populated with users.
